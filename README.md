# Summary
    Built a basic music playlist using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also added Media Queries to try to make the layout of the webpage nice when browsing on different devices.

# Technologies used
    * Visual Stdio Code with Live Server extension and Remote - WSL extensions
    * Ubuntu terminal (Windows Subsystem for Linux" must be turn on (under Windows Features))
    * GitHub
    * W3Schools for references
    * MDN Web Docs for references
    
* For the favicon.ico, I used Flaticon to get a png and then used 
    [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
    [Favicon Converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)

* I used this bootstrap link to get Bootstrap CSS and JS (jQuery, Popper.js, and Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins)
    [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)

* Got links from Google Hosted Libraries just in case
    [Google Hosted Libraries -JQUERY](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries#jquery)

* I used this website to get color gradients
